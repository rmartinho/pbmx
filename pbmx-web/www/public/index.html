        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>With pbmx you can play games that are secure, fair, decentralized, trustless, and asynchronous over any
        transport. The core code has been well-tested, but the bits that interact with the users and the outside world
        are <em>very experimental at the moment, so expect bugs at every corner, unsightly and confusing UI, and general
        wonkiness</em>.

        <p>At the moment, pbmx does not implement the rules for any specific game. It provides generic tools to
        manipulate stacks of cards: shuffle stacks, turn cards face-up, move cards around, show cards to specific
        players, etc. With these the players can play games as they would with physical cards: the physical cards don't
        enforce any particular game's rules, they merely provide a way to manipulate hidden information.

        <h1>Instructions</h1>

        <h2>Basics</h2>

        <p>The core worflow in a pbmx game consists of players exchanging "blocks" with each other. Each block describes
        one or more actions, though at the moment fitting multiple actions in a single block is not supported by this
        interface. A player takes an action and pbmx generates a block for it.

        <p>The player must then broadcast that block to the other players. There is no prescribed way to do this:
        generated blocks are presented as base64 strings that can simply be copied and pasted to and from wherever is
        desired. However, for convenience, there is a simple server available that can automate the exchange of blocks.

        <p>Whenever a block is generated you will see what looks like a bunch of gibberish and two buttons, labeled
        "Publish" and "Done". The gibberish is a representation of the block in base64. You now need to broadcast this
        block to other players.
        
        <p>If you click "Publish", the block will be sent to the block exchange server. It will remain available for a
        few days for other players to retrieve it.
        
        <p>If for some reason you don't want to use the block exchanger, or if the block exchanger is unavailable, you
        can just copy the block representation and send it to the other players through any other means available to
        you (e-mail, Signal, Twitter, postcard, etc). Once you have copied the representation elsewhere, you can click
        "Done".

        <p>There are two ways to receive blocks from other players. If using the block exchanger, you can go to the
        "Blocks" tab, and press "Fetch blocks". This will automatically retrieve any blocks you do not yet have that are
        available at the block exchanger.

        <p>If you received a block representation through other means instead, you can paste it in the box in the
        "Blocks" tab and press "Add block". At the moment you can only add one block at a time in this manner.

        <h2>Starting a game</h2>

        <p>A new game can be started by clicking "New game". A random identifier will be assigned to that game and
        appended to the current URL. In order for other players to join, you can broadcast this URL to them. When a game
        starts, you're presented with the option to provide your nickname for joining the game. Once you click "Join", a
        private/public key pair for you; for now this is stored in your browser. After this, a block will be generated
        and needs to be broadcast to all the other players.

        <p>All the players must perform this joining step. Only once everyone has joined and published their "joining"
        blocks can the game begin. (Note: this is currently not enforced; if a player joins after another player has
        already taken an action, this is likely to cause all sorts of problems and weird behaviour.) All players can
        generate their joining blocks concurrently, so long as no one takes any other action before they all publish
        their joining blocks.
        
        <h2>Coin flipping, or dice rolling</h2>

        <p>At the moment, the only pbmx feature available on this web page is the generation of shared random numbers.
        This process gives the players the guarantee that no player or group of players can cheat and influence the
        result, as long as at least one player is honest (so, if at least <em>you</em> are honest, the other players
        cannot band together to influence the result). Additionally, no player can predict the result from the
        information available to them before the generation is complete. This works in a decentralized fashion without
        the need to trust a third party.

        <p>This is provided for games where coins are flipped, dice are rolled, or random numbers are otherwise
        necessary. This could be simulated with cards: a coin flip is equivalent to shuffling two cards and taking the
        top one. However, doing this using stacks of cards all the time might get cumbersome, so pbmx includes a
        dedicated process for random numbers.

        <p>This feature is available in the "RNGs" tab. Everything is modeled as a series of dice rolls (a coin flip is
        equivalent to rolling a two-sided die). The first step in generating a random number is to specify how the
        number is to be generated. This is done using D&amp;D dice rolling notation: "2d6+3" means "roll 2 six-sided
        dice, and add 3". A simple coin flip can be notated as "1d2". Different dice can be mixed, e.g. "1d6+1d4" means
        "roll a six-sided and a four-sided die and add them together". An <em>n</em>-sided die will generate numbers
        from 0 to <em>n</em>-1, so a six-sided die will produce 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

        <p>One player must initiate the process by giving the roll a name, which must be unique but can be anything,
        specifying the dice to roll using D&amp;D notation, and then pressing "New RNG". This will generate a new block,
        which as always, needs to be broadcast to the other players.

        <p>Now each one of the other players receives that block and then needs to contribute with some entropy to the
        roll. This step can be done concurrently by the players. In order to do so, they need to click the "Provide
        entropy" button on the appropriate generator entry. The browser will generate some random bits and pack them up
        in a new block, which once more needs to be broadcast. A player trying to cheat could attempt to use non-random
        bits, but as explained above, if at least one player is honest and doesn't tamper with the generation of random
        bits, the result will be uniformly random.

        <p>The first player does not need to perform this step, because, in order to streamline the process, it was
        already performed when creating the RNG.

        <p>Once entropy blocks from all players are broadcast and received, the result can be revealed. In order for
        this to be done each player needs to provide a secret value. This is done by clicking "Reveal" in the
        appropriate generator entry, and publishing the corresponding block.

        <p>When all reveal blocks have been received, the RNG entry will merely display the generated number.

        <h1>More info</h1>

        <p>pbmx is an open-source library. The <a href="https://github.com/rmartinho/pbmx">library source code</a> is
        available on GitHub. This website uses that library as a WebAssembly module. It is currently served by GitHub
        Pages, from this <a href="https://github.com/pbmx/pbmx.github.io">repository</a>. The library is
        feature-complete, but this web interface is in very early stages. Everything works without server-generated
        content on this page; everything runs in your browser, with one exception: there is a
        <a href="https://pbmx.herokuapp.com">server for exchanging blocks</a> running on Heroku provided for those who
        want the extra convenience, but its use is entirely optional. You can simply replace any use of that server with
        manually exchanging the blocks over the transport of your choice.
