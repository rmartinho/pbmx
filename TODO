# cli improvements
- less IDs, more names
- enforce validity in fine-grained reset
- save verification checkpoints
- block-specific logs/tail-like logs
- errors

# new game features
- mid-game join/part
- commits for e.g. bidding
- subset/superset/disjoint/no suit proofs
- "glueing"/linked shuffles
- oblivious transfers? 

# primitive improvements
- return blinding factors from VTMF functions so they can be re-combined later
- a couple more primitives instead of saving blinding factors?
- wire format versioning
- distinguish text/binary messages
