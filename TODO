- mid-game join/part
- private masking for e.g. bidding
- subset/superset/disjoint/no suit proofs
- save verification checkpoints
- block-specific logs/tail-like logs
- rework payloads/interface for additional ops
- merge non-CLI crates together
- move more toolkit-ish stuff out of CLI
- return blinding factors from VTMF functions so they can be re-combined later
- save positions/permutations for shuffles, shifts, inserts, etc
- wire format versioning
- a couple more primitives instead of saving blinding factors?
- oblivious transfers?
