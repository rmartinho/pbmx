- use Groth's minimal shuffle
- use Bulletproofs
- wire format versioning
- block-specific logs/tail-like logs
- rework payloads/interface for additional ops
- merge non-CLI crates together
- move more toolkit-ish stuff out of CLI
- save verification checkpoints
- return blinding factors from VTMF functions so they can be re-combined later
